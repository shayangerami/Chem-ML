Homodimeric proteins that behave as allosterically modulated, functional heterodimers, the cyclooxygenases exhibit complex kinetic behavior, requiring peroxide-dependent activation and undergoing suicide inactivation.

In this review, we explore the chemical biology of the cyclooxygenases through the lens of this wealth of structural and functional information. We identify key structural features of the cyclooxygenases, break down their active site into regional binding pockets to facilitate comparisons between structures, and explore similarities and differences in the binding modes of the wide variety of ligands (both substrates and inhibitors) that have been characterized in complex with the enzymes.

Besides aldehydes, ketones, or amines, starting materials have been used that can be converted into an aldehyde or ketone (for instance, carboxylic acids or organic carbonate or nitriles) or into an amine (for instance, a nitro compound) in the presence of the same reducing agent and catalyst. Mechanistically, the reaction starts with a condensation step during which the carbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or an amine, forming the corresponding imine followed by the reduction of the imine to the alkyl amine product. Many of these reduction steps require the presence of a catalyst to activate the reducing agent. The reductive amination is impressive with regard to the product scope since primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines are accessible and hydrogen is the most attractive reducing agent, especially if large-scale product formation is an issue, since hydrogen is inexpensive and abundantly available. Alkyl amines are intensively produced and use fine and bulk chemicals. They are key functional groups in many pharmaceuticals, agro chemicals, or materials. In this review, we summarize the work published on reductive amination employing hydrogen as the reducing agent. No comprehensive review focusing on this subject has been published since 1948, albeit many interesting summaries dealing with one or the other aspect of reductive amination have appeared.

They have found particular use as bioisosteric replacements of several heteroatomic functional groups, notably ureas, thioureas, guanidines, and cyanoguanidines, owing in part to their similar capacity toward hydrogen bonding and ability to reliably engender defined conformations in drug ligands. This Review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the deployment of squaramides as bioisosteres within the drug design landscape. Their utility in this space is further rationalized through an examination of the physicochemical properties of squaramides in contrast to other functional groups.

Owing to novel synthesis strategies resulting in more biocompatible MIPs in the form of soluble nanogels, these synthetic antibodies have found favor in the biomedical domain since 2010, when for the first time, they were shown to capture and eliminate a toxin in live mice. This review, covering the years 2015\u20132020, will first describe the rationale behind these antibody mimics, and the different synthesis methods that have been employed for the preparation of MIPs destined for in vitro and in vivo targeting and bioimaging of cancer biomarkers, an emerging and fast-growing area of MIP applications. MIPs have been synthesized for targeting and visualizing glycans and protein-based cell receptors overexpressed in certain diseases, which are well-known biomarkers for example for tumors. When loaded with drugs, the MIPs could locally kill the tumor cells, making them efficient therapeutic agents. We will end the review by reporting how MIPs themselves can act as therapeutics by inhibiting cancer growth.

Ultimately, the development of new synthetic methods to control key structural features of low-dimensional TMD crystals (e.g., dimensionality, morphology, and phase) will afford access to a broader range of breakthrough properties for this intriguing material class.

After a brief introduction of methods for generating supramolecular hydrogels, we discuss supramolecular hydrogelators on the basis of their categories, such as small organic molecules, coordination complexes, peptides, nucleobases, and saccharides. Following molecular design, we focus on various potential applications of supramolecular hydrogels as molecular biomaterials, classified by their applications in cell cultures, tissue engineering, cell behavior, imaging, and unique applications of hydrogelators. Particularly, we discuss the applications of supramolecular hydrogelators after they form supramolecular assemblies but prior to reaching the critical gelation concentration because this subject is less explored but may hold equally great promise for helping address fundamental questions about the mechanisms or the consequences of the self-assembly of molecules, including low molecular weight ones. Finally, we provide a perspective on supramolecular hydrogelators.

Based on parallel efforts and a mutual consensus now shared by both chemists and physicists, a nanoperiodic/systematic framework concept has emerged. This concept is based on the well-documented existence of discrete, nanoscale collections of traditional inorganic/organic atoms referred to as hard and soft superatoms (i.e., nanoelement categories). These nanometric entities are widely recognized to exhibit nanoscale atom mimicry features reminiscent of traditional picoscale atoms. All unique superatom/nanoelement physicochemical features are derived from quantized structural control defined by six critical nanoscale design parameters (CNDPs), namely, size, shape, surface chemistry, flexibility/rigidity, architecture, and elemental composition. These CNDPs determine all intrinsic superatom properties, their combining behavior to form stoichiometric nanocompounds/assemblies as well as to exhibit nanoperiodic properties leading to new nanoperiodic rules and predictive Mendeleev-like nanoperiodic tables, and they portend possible extension of these principles to larger quantized building blocks including meta-atoms."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00369": {"title": "Supramolecular Polymers in Aqueous Media", "authors": ["Elisha Krieg*", "Maartje M.

In all these fields, the knowledge of the energetics of mixing is capital both to understand the interactions between these fluids and the different substrates and also to establish the energy and environmental cost of possible applications. Due to the relative novelty of the field, the published data is sometimes controversial and recent reviews are fragmentary and do not represent a set of reliable data.

This review focuses on the unwanted production of oxygen gas, which decreases the charge yield by up to 5%. Understanding the factors that control the rate of oxygen production requires understanding of both chemical reactions occurring in the electrolyte, as well as surface reactions occurring on the anodes. The dominant anode material used in chlorate and chlor-alkali production is the dimensionally stable anode (DSA), Ti coated by a mixed oxide of RuO2 and TiO2.

Many such cements are ideally suited to specialist applications in precast construction, road repair, and other fields including nuclear waste immobilization.

Appropriate design of reaction including monomer and enzyme catalyst produces macromolecules with precisely controlled structure, similarly as in vivo enzymatic reactions. The reaction controls the product structure with respect to substrate selectivity, chemo-selectivity, regio-selectivity, stereoselectivity, and choro-selectivity. Oxidoreductases catalyze various oxidation polymerizations of aromatic compounds as well as vinyl polymerizations. Transferases are effective catalysts for producing polysaccharide having a variety of structure and polyesters. Hydrolases catalyzing the bond-cleaving of macromolecules in vivo, catalyze the reverse reaction for bond forming in vitro to give various polysaccharides and functionalized polyesters. The enzymatic polymerizations allowed the first in vitro synthesis of natural polysaccharides having complicated structures like cellulose, amylose, xylan, chitin, hyaluronan, and chondroitin.

In addition, the design and development of novel support and/or multimetallic systems (e.g., alloys, etc.) has also made significant contributions to the field. In this comprehensive review, we report different synthetic approaches to Cu and Cu-based nanoparticles (metallic copper, copper oxides, and hybrid copper nanostructures) and copper nanoparticles immobilized into or supported on various support materials (SiO2, magnetic support materials, etc.), along with their applications in catalysis. The synthesis part discusses numerous preparative protocols for Cu and Cu-based nanoparticles, whereas the application sections describe their utility as catalysts, including electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and gas-phase catalysis.

Its physical and nuclear characteristics (97% \u03b2+ decay, 109.8 min half-life, 635 keV positron energy) and high specific activity make it an attractive nuclide for labeling and molecular imaging. Arenes and heteroarenes are privileged candidates for 18F-incorporation as they are metabolically robust and therefore widely used by medicinal chemists and radiochemists alike.

The experimental methodology exploits velocity map imaging to generate pair-correlated product translational energy distributions from which accurate bond dissociation energies of dimers and trimers and energy disposal in fragments are obtained. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment on bond dissociation energies, energy disposal in fragments, and the contributions of cooperativity demonstrates that it is now possible, with state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical methods, to make accurate predictions about dynamical and energetic properties of dissociating clusters."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00507": {"title": "Stabilizing and Modulating Color by Copigmentation: Insights from Theory and Experiment", "authors": ["Patrick Trouillas*", "Juan C.

Through an examination of theoretical, experimental, and molecular dynamics simulation studies of evaporation, this review will show that the HK relation is incomplete, since it is missing an important physical concept: the coupling between the vapor and liquid phases during evaporation. The review also examines a modified HK relation, obtained from the quantum-mechanically based statistical rate theory (SRT) expression for the evaporation flux and applying a limit to it in which the thermal energy is dominant. Explicit expressions for the evaporation and condensation coefficients are defined in this limit, with the surprising result that the coefficients are not bounded by unity.

This review summarizes recent advances in the analysis of mechanisms of allosteric communication in proteins, and combines this new knowledge to offer a perspective of allostery which is consistent with chemical views of molecular processes. First, we review recent work, particularly computational, on the characterization of signal propagation and conformational changes in allosteric proteins. We then compare different models of allostery, and discuss the significance of the concept of an allosteric pathway. We argue that allostery can be rationalized in terms of pathways of residues that efficiently transmit energy between different binding sites. We then provide examples that show how this picture could account for most of the observed data, since energy flow may be manifested as changes in both structure and dynamics.

QM has been used for the ligand, for a few crucial groups around the ligand, for all the closest atoms (200\u20131000 atoms), or for the full receptor\u2013ligand complex, but it is likely that with a proper embedding it might be enough to include all groups within \u223c6 \u00c5 of the ligand.

Plasma polymer films (PPFs), often deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), currently attract a great deal of attention. Such films are widely used in various fields for the coating of solid substrates, including membranes, semiconductors, metals, textiles, and polymers, because of a combination of interesting properties such as excellent adhesion, highly cross-linked structures, and the possibility of tuning properties by simply varying the precursor and/or the synthesis parameters. Among the many appealing features of plasma-synthesized and -treated polymers, a highly reactive surface, rich in free radicals arising from deposition/treatment specifics, offers a particular advantage.

The most useful synthetic route to Fe2(\u03bc-SR)2(CO)6 involves the reaction of thiols with Fe2(CO)9 and Fe3(CO)12. Such reactions can proceed via mono-, di-, and triiron intermediates. The reactivity of Fe(0) carbonyls toward thiols is highly chemoselective, and the resulting dithiolato complexes are fairly rugged. Thus, many complexes tolerate further synthetic elaboration directed at the organic substituents. A second major route involves alkylation of Fe2(\u03bc-S2)(CO)6, Fe2(\u03bc-SH)2(CO)6, and Li2Fe2(\u03bc-S)2(CO)6. This approach is especially useful for azadithiolates Fe2[(\u03bc-SCH2)2NR](CO)6.

In this review, we take stock of the numerous molecular dynamics simulations that, in the past few decades, have unraveled crucial aspects of crystal nucleation in liquids. We put into context the theoretical framework of classical nucleation theory and the state-of-the-art computational methods by reviewing simulations of such processes as ice nucleation and the crystallization of molecules in solutions. We shall see that molecular dynamics simulations have provided key insights into diverse nucleation scenarios, ranging from colloidal particles to natural gas hydrates, and that, as a result, the general applicability of classical nucleation theory has been repeatedly called into question.

This Review summarizes the needs of natural gas separation, gives an overview of the current technology, and provides a detailed discussion of the progress in research on separation and purification of natural gas including the benefits and drawbacks of each of the processes. The transportation sector is another growing sector of natural gas utilization, and it requires an efficient and safe on-board storage system. Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are the most common forms in which natural gas can be stored. Adsorbed natural gas (ANG) is an alternate storage system of natural gas, which is advantageous as compared to CNG and LNG in terms of safety and also in terms of temperature and pressure requirements. This Review provides a detailed discussion on ANG along with computation predictions.

It is a prerequisite for life and as such a most important subject of current research in chemical physics and physical chemistry. In spite of its simplicity as a liquid, it has an enormously rich phase diagram where different types of ices, amorphous phases, and anomalies disclose a path that points to unique thermodynamics of its supercooled liquid state that still hides many unraveled secrets. In this review we describe the behavior of water in the regime from ambient conditions to the deeply supercooled region. The review describes simulations and experiments on this anomalous liquid. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the anomalous properties that become strongly enhanced in the supercooled region. Among those, the second critical-point scenario has been investigated extensively, and at present most experimental evidence point to this scenario. Starting from very low temperatures, a coexistence line between a high-density amorphous phase and a low-density amorphous phase would continue in a coexistence line between a high-density and a low-density liquid phase terminating in a liquid\u2013liquid critical point, LLCP. On approaching this LLCP from the one-phase region, a crossover in thermodynamics and dynamics can be found. This is discussed based on a picture of a temperature-dependent balance between a high-density liquid and a low-density liquid favored by, respectively, entropy and enthalpy, leading to a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of bulk water. Ice nucleation is also discussed, since this is what severely impedes experimental investigation of the vicinity of the proposed LLCP. Experimental investigation of stretched water, i.e., water at negative pressure, gives access to a different regime of the complex water diagram. Different ways to inhibit crystallization through confinement and aqueous solutions are discussed through results from experiments and simulations using the most sophisticated and advanced techniques. These findings represent tiles of a global picture that still needs to be completed.

From a mechanistic perspective, we have focused on one particular group of DNA transposons that encode a transposase with a DD(E/D) catalytic domain that is topologically similar to RNase H.

In this regard, using transition metals to catalyze the synthesis of organohalides has become a mature field in itself, and applying these technologies has allowed for a decrease in the production of waste, higher levels of regio- and stereoselectivity, and the ability to produce enantioenriched target compounds. Furthermore, transition metals offer the distinct advantage of possessing a diverse spectrum of mechanistic possibilities which translate to the capability to apply new substrate classes and afford novel and difficult-to-access structures.

A mirror process also occurs in which photocurrent is generated through photoexcitation of the acceptor followed by hole transfer to the nonexcited donor or photoinduced hole transfer (PHT), which we term Channel II.

The various N-substituents include nitrogen-, oxygen-, phosphorus-, sulfur-, halogen-, and silicon-based functionalities and directly N-bound metals. Multiple DPPA-type ligands linked through an organic spacer and N-functionalized DRPA-type ligands, in which the PPh2 substituents are replaced by PR2 (R = alkyl, benzyl) groups, are also discussed. Owing to the considerable diversity of N-functionalized DPPA-type ligands available, the applications of their mono- and polynuclear metal complexes are very diverse and range from homogeneous catalysis with well-defined or in situ generated (pre)catalysts to heterogeneous catalysis and materials science. In particular, sustained interest for DPPA-type ligands has been motivated, at least in part, by their ability to promote selective ethylene tri- or tetramerization in combination with chromium. Ligands and metal complexes where the N-substituent is a pure hydrocarbon group (as opposed to N-functionalization) are outside the scope of this review.

Defect-induced anisotropy is a growth method which relies on the presence of topological defects at the nanoscale to induce 2D shapes objects. Such a method is particularly important in the growth of metallic nano-objects. Another way to induce anisotropy is based on ligand engineering. The availability of some nanocrystal facets can be tuned by selectively covering the surface with ligands of tunable thickness. Cadmium chalcogenides nanoplatelets (NPLs) strongly rely on this method which offers atomic control in the thinner direction, down to a few monolayers. Two-dimensional objects can also be obtained by post or in situ self-assembly of nanocrystals. This growth method differs from the previous ones in the sense that the elementary objects are not molecular precursors and is a common method for lead chalcogenide compounds. Finally, anisotropy may simply rely on the lattice anisotropy itself as it is common for rod-like nanocrystals. Colloidally grown transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) in particular result from such process. We also present hybrid syntheses which combine several of the previously described methods and other paths, such as cation exchange, which expand the range of available materials.

Thermodynamic hydricity is the free energy required to cleave an M\u2013H bond to generate a hydride ion (H\u2013). Three primary methods have been developed for hydricity determination: the hydride transfer method establishes hydride transfer equilibrium with a hydride donor/acceptor pair of known hydricity, the H2 heterolysis method involves measuring the equilibrium of heterolytic cleavage of H2 in the presence of a base, and the potential\u2013pKa method considers stepwise transfer of a proton and two electrons to give a net hydride transfer.

From the molecular orbital construction of these ligand field splittings evolves a strategy for inverting the normal order: the obvious way to achieve this is to raise the ligand levels above the metal d\u2019s; that is, make the ligands better Lewis bases. However, things are not so simple, for such metal/ligand level placement may lead to redox processes. For 18-electron octahedral complexes one can create the inverted situation, but it manifests itself in the makeup of valence orbitals (are they mainly on metal or ligands?) rather than energy. One can also see the effect, in small ways, in tetrahedral Zn(II) complexes. We construct several examples of inverted ligand field systems with a hypothetical but not unrealistic AlCH3 ligand and sketch the consequences of inversion on reactivity. Special attention is paid to the square-planar case, exemplified by [Cu(CF3)4]\u2212, in which Snyder had the foresight to see a case of an inverted field, with the empty valence orbital being primarily ligand centered, the dx2-y2 orbital heavily occupied, in what would normally be called a Cu(III) complex. For [Cu(CF3)4]\u2212 we provide theoretical evidence from electron distributions, geometry of the ligands, thermochemistry of molecule formation, and the energetics of abstraction of a CF3 ligand by a base, all consistent with oxidation of the ligands in this molecule. In [Cu(CF3)4]\u2212, and perhaps more complexes on the right side of the transition series than one has imagined, some ligands are \u03c3-noninnocent. Exploration of inverted ligand fields helps us see the continuous, borderless transition from transition metal to main group bonding.

The H\u2013 anion is also believed to have been critical to the formation of molecular hydrogen in the very early evolution of the Universe.

Even though these two macrocycles contain 22\u03c0 electrons and five pyrrole/heterocyclic rings, they are structurally different. In sapphyrins, the five pyrrole/heterocyclic rings are connected through four meso-carbon bridges and one direct pyrrole\u2013pyrrole bond, whereas in smaragdyrins, the five pyrrole/heterocyclic rings are connected through three meso-carbon bridges and two direct pyrrole\u2013pyrrole bonds.

The availability of oxasmaragdyrin allowed the exploration of smaragdyrin in recent years.

Its four-electron oxidation leads to the \u201ctransitory\u201d 20\u03c0 isophlorin, which undergoes subsequent two-electron oxidation to form the 18\u03c0 \u201cporphyrin\u201d.

However, a major aspect of its unstable nature was attributed to its antiaromatic character, which is understood to destabilize the macrocycle upon conjugation. Antiaromaticity in general has not gained significant attention mainly due to the lack of stable 4n\u03c0 systems.

SRS is a nonlinear technique that probes the same vibrational modes of molecules that are seen in spontaneous Raman scattering. While spontaneous Raman scattering is an incoherent technique, SRS is a coherent process, and this fact provides several advantages over conventional Raman techniques, among which are much stronger signals and the ability to time-resolve the vibrational motions. Technological improvements in pulse generation and detection strategies have allowed SRS to probe increasingly smaller volumes and shorter time scales.

The most common orbital pathways mediating ligand noninnocence in transition-metal corroles are the metal(dz2)\u2013corrole(\u201ca2u\u201d) interaction (most commonly observed in Mn and Fe corroles) and the metal(dx2\u2013y2)\u2013corrole(a2u) interaction in coinage metal corroles.

This review demonstrates the principles and applications of solid-state NMR by unifying dipolar and quadrupolar interactions and highlights the unique features offered by solid-state 2H NMR with experimental illustrations. For randomly oriented multilamellar lipids or aligned membranes, solid-state 2H NMR enables direct measurement of residual quadrupolar couplings (RQCs) due to individual C\u20132H-labeled segments. The distribution of RQC values gives nearly complete profiles of the segmental order parameters SCD(i) as a function of acyl segment position (i). Alternatively, one can measure residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) for natural abundance lipid samples to obtain segmental SCH order parameters. A theoretical mean-torque model provides acyl-packing profiles representing the cumulative chain extension along the normal to the aqueous interface. Equilibrium structural properties of fluid bilayers and various thermodynamic quantities can then be calculated, which describe the interactions with cholesterol, detergents, peptides, and integral membrane proteins and formation of lipid rafts. One can also obtain direct information for membrane-bound peptides or proteins by measuring RDCs using magic-angle spinning (MAS) in combination with dipolar recoupling methods.

Volatile compounds are, for example, characteristics of food where some of them can be perceivable by humans because of their aroma. They have a great influence on the decision making of consumers when they choose to use a product or not. In the case where a product has an offensive and strong aroma, many consumers might not appreciate it. On the contrary, soft and fresh natural aromas definitely increase the acceptance of a given product. These properties can drastically influence the economy; thus, it has been of great importance to manufacturers that the aroma of their food product is characterized by analytical means to provide a basis for further optimization processes. A lot of research has been devoted to this domain in order to link the quality of, e.g., a food to its aroma. By knowing the aromatic profile of a food, one can understand the nature of a given product leading to developing new products, which are more acceptable by consumers. There are two ways to analyze volatiles: one is to use human senses and/or sensory instruments, and the other is based on advanced analytical techniques. This work focuses on the latter. Although requirements are simple, low-cost technology is an attractive research target in this domain; most of the data are generated with very high-resolution analytical instruments. Such data gathered based on different analytical instruments normally have broad, overlapping sensitivity profiles and require substantial data analysis. In this review, we have addressed not only  the question of the application of chemometrics for aroma analysis but also of the use of different analytical instruments in this field, highlighting the research needed for future focus."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00700": {"title": "Near-Infrared Fluorescent Proteins, Biosensors, and Optogenetic Tools Engineered from Phytochromes", "authors": ["Konstantin G.

In particular, the most recent time-resolved heterodyne-detected VSFG and two-dimensional heterodyne-detected VSFG unveil the inhomogeneity of the hydrogen bond and relevant vibrational dynamics of interfacial water through unambiguous observation of hole-burning in the OH stretch band, as well as the subsequent spectral diffusion in the femtosecond time region.

Homogeneous (gas/liquid) systems that convert methane to functionalized products with emphasis on reports after 1995 are reviewed. Gas/solid, bioinorganic, biological, and reaction systems that do not specifically involve methane functionalization are excluded. The various reports are grouped under the main element involved in the direct reactions with methane. Central to the review is classification of the various reports into 12 categories based on both practical considerations and the mechanisms of the elementary reactions with methane. Practical considerations are based on whether or not the system reported can directly or indirectly utilize O2 as the only net coreactant based only on thermodynamic potentials. Mechanistic classifications are based on whether the elementary reactions with methane proceed by chain or nonchain reactions and with stoichiometric reagents or catalytic species. The nonchain reactions are further classified as CH activation (CHA) or CH oxidation (CHO). The bases for these various classifications are defined. In particular, CHA reactions are defined as elementary reactions with methane that result in a discrete methyl intermediate where the formal oxidation state (FOS) on the carbon remains unchanged at \u2212IV relative to that in methane. In contrast, CHO reactions are defined as elementary reactions with methane where the carbon atom of the product is oxidized and has a FOS less negative than \u2212IV. This review reveals that the bulk of the work in the field is relatively evenly distributed across most of the various areas classified. However, a few areas are only marginally examined, or not examined at all. This review also shows that, while significant scientific progress has been made, greater advances, particularly in developing systems that can utilize O2, will be required to develop a practical process that can replace the current energy and capital intensive natural gas conversion process. We believe that this classification scheme will provide the reader with a rapid way to identify systems of interest while providing a deeper appreciation and understanding, both practical and fundamental, of the extensive literature on methane functionalization.

They are distinctly different from nanoparticles in their spectroscopic properties such as optical absorption and emission, showing well-defined features, just like molecules. They show isotopically resolved molecular ion peaks in mass spectra and provide diverse information when examined through multiple instrumental methods. Most important of these properties is luminescence, often in the visible\u2013near-infrared window, useful in biological applications. Luminescence in the visible region, especially by clusters protected with proteins, with a large Stokes shift, has been used for various sensing applications, down to a few tens of molecules/ions, in air and water. Catalytic properties of clusters, especially oxidation of organic substrates, have been examined. Materials science of these systems presents numerous possibilities and is fast evolving. Computational insights have given reasons for their stability and unusual properties. The molecular nature of these materials is unequivocally manifested in a few recent studies such as intercluster reactions forming precise clusters. These systems manifest properties of the core, of the ligand shell, as well as that of the integrated system. They are better described as protected molecules or aspicules, where aspis means shield and cules refers to molecules, implying that they are \u201cshielded molecules\u201d. In order to understand their diverse properties, a nomenclature has been introduced with which it is possible to draw their structures with positional labels on paper, with some training. Research in this area is captured here, based on the publications available up to December 2016."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00770": {"title": "Capturing Chemistry in Action with Electrons: Realization of Atomically Resolved Reaction Dynamics", "authors": ["Anatoly A.

The depiction of the nuclear configurations in space-time to understand barrier crossing events has served as a unifying intellectual theme connecting the different disciplines of chemistry. This challenge has been cast as an imaging problem in which the technical issues reduce to achieving not only sufficient simultaneous space-time resolution but also brightness for sufficient image contrast to capture the atomic motions. This objective has been met with electrons as the imaging source. The review chronicles the first use of electron structural probes to study reactive intermediates, to the development of high bunch charge electron pulses with sufficient combined spatial-temporal resolution and intensity to literally light up atomic motions, as well as the means to characterize the electron pulses in terms of temporal brightness and image reconstruction. The use of femtosecond Rydberg spectroscopy as a novel means to use internal electron scattering within the molecular reference frame to obtain similar information on reaction dynamics is also discussed. The focus is on atomically resolved chemical reaction dynamics with pertinent references to work in other areas and forms of spectroscopy that provide additional information. Effectively, we can now directly observe the far-from-equilibrium atomic motions involved in barrier crossing and categorize chemistry in terms of a power spectrum of a few dominant reaction modes. It is this reduction in dimensionality that makes chemical reaction mechanisms transferrable to seemingly arbitrarily complex (large N) systems, up to molecules as large as biological macromolecules (N > 1000 atoms). We now have a new way to reformulate reaction mechanisms using an experimentally determined dynamic mode basis that in combination with recent theoretical advances has the potential to lead to a new conceptual basis for chemistry that forms a natural link between structure and dynamics."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00772": {"title": "Iron-Catalyzed C\u2013H Bond Activation", "authors": ["Rui Shang", "Laurean Ilies*", "Eiichi Nakamura*"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2017, "volume": 117, "issue": 13, "page_start": 9086, "page_end": 9139, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "April 5, 2017", "abstract": "Catalytic C\u2013H bond activation, which was an elusive subject of chemical research until the 1990s, has now become a standard synthetic method for the formation of new C\u2013C and C\u2013heteroatom bonds.

Polypeptides are generally too large and polar to passively diffuse through lipid membranes, while most known active transport mechanisms facilitate cell uptake of only very small peptides. Systematic evaluations of peptides with molecular weights above 500 Da are needed to identify parameters that influence oral bioavailability. Here we describe 125 cyclic peptides containing four to thirty-seven amino acids that are orally absorbed by mammals. Cyclization minimizes degradation in the gut, blood, and tissues by removing cleavable N- and C-termini and by shielding components from metabolic enzymes. Cyclization also folds peptides into bioactive conformations that determine exposure of polar atoms to solvation by water and lipids and therefore can influence oral bioavailability. Key chemical properties thought to influence oral absorption and bioavailability are analyzed, including molecular weight, octanol\u2013water partitioning, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, and polar surface area. The cyclic peptides violated to different degrees all of the limits traditionally considered to be important for oral bioavailability of drug-like small molecules, although fewer hydrogen bond donors and reduced flexibility generally favored oral absorption."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00839": {"title": "Computational Studies of Carboxylate-Assisted C\u2013H Activation and Functionalization at Group 8\u201310 Transition Metal Centers", "authors": ["David L.

Further progress with rechargeable batteries may require new chemistries (lithium ion batteries and beyond) and better understanding of materials electrochemistry in the various battery technologies. In the past decade, advancement of battery materials has been complemented by new analytical techniques that are capable of probing battery chemistries at various length and time scales. Synchrotron X-ray techniques stand out as one of the most effective methods that allow for nearly nondestructive probing of materials characteristics such as electronic and geometric structures with various depth sensitivities through spectroscopy, scattering, and imaging capabilities. This article begins with the discussion of various rechargeable batteries and associated important scientific questions in the field, followed by a review of synchrotron X-ray based analytical tools (scattering, spectroscopy, and imaging) and their successful applications (ex situ, in situ, and in operando) in gaining fundamental insights into these scientific questions. Furthermore, electron microscopy and spectroscopy complement the detection length scales of synchrotron X-ray tools and are also discussed toward the end. We highlight the importance of studying battery materials by combining analytical techniques with complementary length sensitivities, such as the combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy with spatial resolution, because a sole technique may lead to biased and inaccurate conclusions.

Consequently, a high proportion of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals on the market today possess halogens. Halogenated organic compounds are also common intermediates in synthesis and are particularly valuable in metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.

Phosphorescence is the simplest physical process which provides an example of spin-forbidden transformation with a characteristic spin selectivity and magnetic field dependence, being the model also for more complicated chemical reactions and for spin catalysis applications. The bridging of the spin prohibition in phosphorescence is commonly analyzed by perturbation theory, which considers the intensity borrowing from spin-allowed electronic transitions.

DNA is highly stable, cost-effective, easy to modify, and amenable to combinatorial selection. Two main classes of functional DNA were developed for metal sensing: aptamers and DNAzymes. While a few metal binding aptamers are known, it is generally quite difficult to isolate such aptamers.

Second, the design of surface functionalities and transducing path, the characterization of interfacial architectures, and the integration of multiple nanoscale components into multifunctional ordered nanostructures are extensively examined. Third, examples of current biosensing structures created from hybrid nanomaterials are reviewed, with a distinct emphasis on the need to tailor nanosensor designs to specific operating environments. Finally, we offer a perspective on the future developments of nanohybrid materials and future nanosensors, outline possible directions to be pursued that may yield breakthrough results, and envision the exciting potential of high-performance nanomaterials that will cause disruptive improvements in the field of biosensing."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00090": {"title": "Oximes and Hydrazones in Bioconjugation: Mechanism and Catalysis", "authors": ["Dominik K.

Recent strategies for installing reactive carbonyl groups and \u03b1-nucleophiles into biomolecules are described. The basic chemical properties of reactants and products in this reaction are then reviewed, with an eye to understanding the reaction\u2019s mechanism and how reactant structure controls rates and equilibria in the process. Recent work that has uncovered structural features and new mechanisms for speeding the reaction, sometimes by orders of magnitude, is discussed. We describe recent studies that have identified especially fast reacting aldehyde/ketone substrates and structural effects that lead to rapid-reacting \u03b1-nucleophiles as well. Among the most effective new strategies has been the development of substituents near the reactive aldehyde group that either transfer protons at the transition state or trap the initially formed tetrahedral intermediates. In addition, the recent development of efficient nucleophilic catalysts for the reaction is outlined, improving greatly upon aniline, the classical catalyst for imine formation. A number of uses of such second- and third-generation catalysts in bioconjugation and in cellular applications are highlighted. While formation of hydrazone and oxime has been traditionally regarded as being limited by slow rates, developments in the past 5 years have resulted in completely overturning this limitation; indeed, the reaction is now one of the fastest and most versatile reactions available for conjugations of biomolecules and biomaterials."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00091": {"title": "Metal\u2013Organic Frameworks for Heterogeneous Basic Catalysis", "authors": ["Li Zhu", "Xiao-Qin Liu", "Hai-Long Jiang", "Lin-Bing Sun*"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2017, "volume": 117, "issue": 12, "page_start": 8129, "page_end": 8176, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "May 25, 2017", "abstract": "Great attention has been given to metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived solid bases because of their attractive structure and catalytic performance in various organic reactions.

The past decade has witnessed remarkable advances in this vibrant research area; however, MOFs for heterogeneous basic catalysis have never been reviewed until now. Therefore, a review summarizing MOFs-derived base catalysts is highly expected. In this review, we present an overview of the recent progress in MOFs-derived solid bases covering preparation, characterization, and catalytic applications. In the preparation section, the solid bases are divided into two categories, namely, MOFs with intrinsic basicity and MOFs with modified basicity. The basicity can originate from either metal sites or organic ligands. Different approaches used for  generation of basic sites are included, and each approach is described with representative examples. The fundamental principles for the design and fabrication of MOFs with basic functionalities are featured. In the characterization section, experimental techniques and theoretical calculations employed for characterization of basic MOFs are summarized. Some representive experimental techniques, such as temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) and infrared (IR) spectra of different probing molecules, are covered. Following preparation and characterization, the catalytic applications of MOFs-derived solid bases are dealt with. These solid bases have potential to catalyze some well-known \u201cbase-catalyzed reactions\u201d like Knoevenagel condensation, aldol condensation, and Michael addition. Meanwhile, in contrast to conventional solid bases, MOFs show some different catalytic properties due to their special structural and surface properties.

Using several representative examples, we discuss various optical phenomena, including absorption and transparency, diffraction, interference, reflection and antireflection, scattering, light harvesting, wave guiding and lensing, camouflage, and bioluminescence, that are responsible for the unique optical properties of materials and structures found in nature and biology. Great strides in understanding the design principles adapted by nature have led to a tremendous progress in realizing biomimetic and bioinspired optical materials and photonic devices.

The mechanism and dynamics of O2 dissociation are also reviewed, including the importance of the spin transition. The reactivity of O2 and O toward reactant molecules is also briefly discussed in the context of catalysis. The reactivity of a surface toward O2 generally correlates with the adsorption strength of O, the tendency to oxidize, and the heat of formation of the oxide. Periodic trends can be rationalized in terms of attractive and repulsive interactions with the d-band, such that inert metals tend to feature a full d band that is low energy and has a large spatial overlap with adsorbate states. More open surfaces or undercoordinated defect sites can be much more reactive than close-packed surfaces. Reactions between O and other species tend to be more prevalent than reactions between O2 and other species, particularly on more reactive surfaces."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00218": {"title": "Super-Resolution Structured Illumination Microscopy", "authors": ["Rainer Heintzmann*", "Thomas Huser*"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2017, "volume": 117, "issue": 23, "page_start": 13890, "page_end": 13908, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "November 10, 2017", "abstract": "Super-resolved structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) is among the most rapidly growing fluorescence microscopy techniques that can surpass the optical diffraction limit.

The basics of this recently developed technique are first introduced with descriptions of the experimental requirements and data analysis including the details of mode assignments. We discuss the use of NRVS to probe 57Fe at the center of heme and heme protein derivatives yielding the vibrational density of states for the iron. The application to derivatives with diatomic ligands (O2, NO, CO, CN\u2013) shows the strong capabilities of identifying mode character. The availability of the complete vibrational spectrum of iron allows the identification of modes not available by other techniques.

Electrolysis is participating in the trend toward continuous flow synthesis, and this has led to a number of innovations in flow cell design that make possible selective syntheses with high conversion of reactant to product with a single passage of the reactant solution through the cell. In addition, the needs of the synthetic organic chemist can often be met by flow cells operating with recycle of the reactant solution. These cells give a high rate of product formation while the reactant concentration is high, but they perform best at low conversion. Both approaches are considered in this review and the important features of each cell design are discussed. Throughout, the application of the cell designs is illustrated with syntheses that have been reported."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00364": {"title": "Colloidal Plasmonic Nanocomposites: From Fabrication to Optical Function", "authors": ["Su-Wen Hsu", "Andrea L.

These reactive intermediates, including metal-superoxo, -(hydro)peroxo, and high-valent metal\u2013oxo species, are the basis for the various biological functions of O2-utilizing metalloproteins.

Much of our understanding of the reactivity of these reactive intermediates has come from the study of heme-containing proteins and related metalloporphyrin compounds. These studies not only have deepened our understanding of various functions of heme proteins, such as O2 storage and transport, degradation of reactive oxygen species, redox signaling, and biological oxygenation, etc., but also have driven the development of bioinorganic chemistry and biomimetic catalysis. In this review, we survey the range of O2 activation processes mediated by heme proteins and model compounds with a focus on recent progress in the characterization and reactivity of important iron\u2013oxygen intermediates. Representative reactions initiated by these reactive intermediates as well as some context from prior decades will also be presented.

Polyoxometalates are anionic metal oxide clusters of a variety of structures that are soluble in liquid phases and therefore amenable to homogeneous catalytic transformations. Often, they are active for electron transfer oxidations of a myriad of substrates and upon reduction can be reoxidized by molecular oxygen. For example, the phosphovanadomolybdate, H5PV2Mo10O40, can oxidize Pd(0) thereby enabling aerobic reactions catalyzed by Pd and H5PV2Mo10O40. In a similar vein, polyoxometalates can stabilize metal nanoparticles, leading to additional transformations. Furthermore, electron transfer oxidation of other substrates such as halides and sulfur-containing compounds is possible. More uniquely, H5PV2Mo10O40 and its analogues can mediate electron transfer-oxygen transfer reactions where oxygen atoms are transferred from the polyoxometalate to the substrate. This unique property has enabled correspondingly unique transformations involving carbon\u2013carbon, carbon\u2013hydrogen, and carbon\u2013metal bond activation. The pathway for the reoxidation of vanadomolybdates with O2 appears to be an inner-sphere reaction, but the oxidation of one-electron reduced polyoxotungstates has been shown through intensive research to be an outer-sphere reaction. Beyond electron transfer and electron transfer\u2013oxygen transfer aerobic transformations, there a few examples of apparent dioxygenase activity where both oxygen atoms are donated to a substrate."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00449": {"title": "From Noncovalent Chalcogen\u2013Chalcogen Interactions to Supramolecular Aggregates: Experiments and Calculations", "authors": ["Rolf Gleiter*", "Gebhard Haberhauer*", "Daniel B.

Concerning the crystallization process, flow can accelerate the kinetics by orders of magnitude and induce the formation of oriented crystallites like shish-kebab, which are associated with the major influences of flow on nucleation, that is, raised nucleation density and oriented nuclei. The topic of FIC has been studied for more than half a century.

By a combination of these advanced methods, the evolution process of FIC can be revealed more precisely (with higher time resolution and on more length scales) and quantitatively. The new findings are challenging the classical interpretations and theories that were mostly derived from quiescent or mild-flow conditions, and they are triggering the reconsideration of FIC foundations. This review mainly summarizes experimental results, advances in physical understanding, and discussions on the multiscale and multistep nature of oriented nuclei induced by strong flow. The multiscale structures include segmental conformation, packing of conformational ordering, deformation on the whole-chain scale, and macroscopic aggregation of crystallites.

In this approach, a polar functional group, namely, a \u201cdirecting group\u201d, in the vicinity of the reactive site inside the substrate has been documented to preassociate with the chiral catalyst, which exerts stereodirecting influence by directing the reacting partner toward one of the enantiotopic faces of the reaction center.

Likewise, the substrate directed approach has been applied to functionalize enantiopure substrates bearing pre-exisiting stereocenters into complex structures as a single diastereomer.

Due to the large number of related applications, only recent advances that have been documented within the last two decades have been reviewed. Furthermore, in the current review, we have mainly highlighted asymmetric reactions that are controlled by abundant and frequently used directing groups such as hydroxy, amide, and sulfonamide groups. In addition, selected examples of a few important substrate-directed chemo-, regio-, and diastereoselective reactions have also been included in this review."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00519": {"title": "Life under the Microscope: Single-Molecule Fluorescence Highlights the RNA World", "authors": ["Sujay Ray", "Julia R.

The active transport mechanism can be illustrated by the Panama Canal model, which considers two gates and a gain in energy. The Panama Canal model is consistent with the alternating access model that is used to describe active transport, in which the substrate ion is bound, energized, and released. It was generally accepted that energization occurs only for an ion-bound protein but not for an ion-unbound protein. Light-driven proton and chloride pumps, two of the best studied pumps, are represented by the Panama Canal model. In this case, light absorption takes place for the bound state of ions (proton and chloride ions) in the active center (protonated Schiff base of the retinal chromophore). In contrast, a recently discovered light-driven sodium pump, Krokinobacter eikastus rhodopsin 2 (KR2), is a unique active transporter that does not bind the transport substrate, the sodium ion, in its resting state. The molecular architecture and photoreaction cycle of the light-driven sodium pump are very similar to those of proton and chloride pumps, although sodium ions are actively transported without initial binding. Sodium uptake is a diffusive process, but the presence of two gates allows the unidirectional transport of sodium ions. In this sense, the light-driven sodium pump is also represented by a modified Panama Canal model.

It plays an important role in the excited state decay dynamics of many molecular systems and not just those containing heavy elements. In the simplest case, ISC is driven by direct spin\u2013orbit coupling between two states of different multiplicities. This coupling is usually assumed to remain unchanged by vibrational motion. It is also often presumed that spin-allowed radiationless transitions, i.e. internal conversion, and the nonadiabatic coupling that drives them, can be considered separately from ISC and spin\u2013orbit coupling owing to the vastly different time scales upon which these processes are assumed to occur. However, these assumptions are too restrictive. Indeed, the strong mixing brought about by the simultaneous presence of nonadiabatic and spin\u2013orbit coupling means that often the spin, electronic, and vibrational dynamics cannot be described independently. Instead of considering a simple ladder of states, as depicted in a Jablonski diagram, one must consider the more complicated spin-vibronic levels. Despite the basic ideas being outlined in the 1960s, it is only with the advent of high-level theory and femtosecond spectroscopy that the importance of the spin-vibronic mechanism for ISC in both fundamental as well as applied research fields has been revealed with significant impact across chemistry, physics, and biology. In this review article, we present the theory and fundamental principles of the spin-vibronic mechanism for ISC. This is followed by empirical rules to estimate the rate of ISC within this regime. The most recent developments in experimental techniques, theoretical methods, and models for the spin-vibronic mechanism are discussed.

In this review, we present nanocellulose-based materials from sourcing, synthesis, and surface modification of nanocellulose, to materials formation and applications. Nanocellulose can be sourced from biomass, plants, or bacteria, relying on fairly simple, scalable, and efficient isolation techniques. Mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments, or a combination of these, can be used to extract nanocellulose from natural sources. The properties of nanocellulose are dependent on the source, the isolation technique, and potential subsequent surface transformations. Nanocellulose surface modification techniques are typically used to introduce either charged or hydrophobic moieties, and include amidation, esterification, etherification, silylation, polymerization, urethanization, sulfonation, and phosphorylation. Nanocellulose has excellent strength, high Young\u2019s modulus, biocompatibility, and tunable self-assembly, thixotropic, and photonic properties, which are essential for the applications of this material. Nanocellulose participates in the fabrication of a large range of nanomaterials and nanocomposites, including those based on polymers, metals, metal oxides, and carbon. In particular, nanocellulose complements organic-based materials, where it imparts its mechanical properties to the composite.

The interaction of plasmonic molecules with light leads to excitations that are classified using the concept of normal modes. The simplest plasmonic molecule is a dimer of particles, and its lowest energy excitation takes the form of a symmetric dipolar mode. More complex excitations take place when a larger number of particles is involved. The gaps between particles in a plasmonic molecule form hotspots in which the electromagnetic field is concentrated. Introducing molecules into these hotspots is the basis of a vast spectrum of enhanced spectroscopies, from surface-enhanced Raman scattering to surface-enhanced fluorescence and others.

The rate of the hydroformylation step needs to be fast with regard to the hydrogenation step. The role of amines in the coordination sphere and water, presumably in the second sphere, on the mechanism requires some more studies. Similarly, the enantioselective synthesis of amine is not yet achieved directly and interrupted processes or use of asymmetric organo-catalyzed reductive amination are efficient synthetic ways for producing chiral amines. The separation of the catalyst from the organic products by biphasic or (semi-) heterogeneized systems and its recycling have been demonstrated in many cases. The present review provides a report of the state of the art in this autotandem hydroaminomethylation catalysis and should open prospects in the design of less expensive and abundant metal complexes for reaching at low cost similar and even superior performances."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00668": {"title": "Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for Bioanalysis: Reliability and Challenges", "authors": ["Cheng Zong", "Mengxi Xu", "Li-Jia Xu", "Ting Wei", "Xin Ma", "Xiao-Shan Zheng", "Ren Hu", "Bin Ren*"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2018, "volume": 118, "issue": 10, "page_start": 4946, "page_end": 4980, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "April 11, 2018", "abstract": "Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) inherits the rich chemical fingerprint information on Raman spectroscopy and gains sensitivity by plasmon-enhanced excitation and scattering.

However, it is equally clear that DNA polymerases possess distinct differences that often prescribe a particular cellular role. Indeed, a unified kinetic mechanism to explain all aspects of DNA polymerase catalysis, including DNA binding, nucleotide binding and incorporation, and metal-ion-assisted nucleotidyltransfer (i.e., chemistry), has been difficult to define. In particular, the contributions of enzyme conformational dynamics to several mechanistic steps and their implications for replication fidelity are complex. Moreover, recent time-resolved X-ray crystallographic studies of DNA polymerases have uncovered a third divalent metal ion present during DNA synthesis, the function of which is currently unclear and debated within the field. In this review, we survey past and current literature describing the structures and kinetic mechanisms of DNA polymerases from each family to explore every major mechanistic step while emphasizing the impact of enzyme conformational dynamics on DNA synthesis and replication fidelity.

This means that only odd-length walks on a molecular graph contribute to the conductivity through a molecule. Thus, if there are only even-length walks between two atoms, quantum interference is expected to occur in the electron transport between them. However, even if there are only odd-length walks between two atoms, a situation may come about where the contributions to the QI of some odd-length walks are canceled by others, leading to another class of quantum interference.

Forty-one of these zeolites can be synthesized, and the first synthetic zeolite (KFI, 1948) was in fact a small-pore material. Although the field of 8MR zeolite chemistry has expanded in many directions, the progress in synthesis is framework-specific, leaving insights and generalizations difficult to realize. This review first focuses on the relevant synthesis details of all 8MR zeolites and provides some generalized findings and related insights. Next, catalytic applications where 8MR zeolites either have been commercialized or have dominated investigations are presented, with the aim of providing structure\u2013activity relationships. The review ends with a summary that discusses (i) both synthetic and catalytic progress, (ii) a list of opportunities in the 8MR zeolite field, and (iii) a brief future outlook."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00741": {"title": "Introduction: Biocatalysis in Industry", "authors": [], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2018, "volume": 118, "issue": 1, "page_start": 1, "page_end": 3, "article_type": "Editorial", "pub_date": "January 10, 2018", "abstract": null}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00742": {"title": "Addition and Correction to Environmental Implications of Hydroxyl Radicals (\u2022OH)", "authors": ["Sasho Gligorovski*", "Rafal Strekowski", "Stephane Barbati", "Davide Vione*"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2018, "volume": 118, "issue": 4, "page_start": 2296, "page_end": 2296, "article_type": "Addition/Correction", "pub_date": "January 8, 2018", "abstract": null}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00756": {"title": "Introduction: Posttranslational Protein Modification", "authors": [], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2018, "volume": 118, "issue": 3, "page_start": 887, "page_end": 888, "article_type": "Editorial", "pub_date": "February 14, 2018", "abstract": null}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00757": {"title": "Incorporating Carbohydrates into Laboratory Curricula", "authors": ["Jennifer Koviach-C\u00f4t\u00e9", "Alyssa L.

Generally, the hydrolysis of acid-labile linkages, including acetal, imine, hydrazone, and to some extent \u03b2-thiopropionate, are relatively fast and the conjugated drug can be completely released in the range of several hours to a few days.

Their dysregulation is often associated with neurological disorders, developmental abnormalities, or cancer. Methyllysine-containing proteins can be recognized by downstream effector proteins, which contain methyllysine reader domains, to relay their biological functions.

This imbalance in neurotransmission can be corrected by inhibition of the enzyme \u03b3-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-AT), which catalyzes the conversion of GABA to the excitatory neurotransmitter l-glutamic acid. It also has been found that raising GABA levels can antagonize the rapid elevation and release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, which is responsible for the reward response in addiction. Therefore, the design of new inhibitors of GABA-AT, which increases brain GABA levels, is an important approach to new treatments for epilepsy and addiction. This review summarizes findings over the last 40 or so years of mechanism-based inactivators (unreactive compounds that require the target enzyme to catalyze their conversion to the inactivating species, which inactivate the enzyme prior to their release) of GABA-AT with emphasis on their catalytic mechanisms of inactivation, presented according to organic chemical mechanism, with minimal pharmacology, except where important for activity in epilepsy and addiction.

Photoelectron spectroscopy is one of the main techniques for characterizing surface of a catalyst since it\u2019s a surface sensitive technique.

It may be argued that HICs began as aqueous systems, based on a Faradaic oxide positive electrode (e.g., Co3O4, RuOx) and an activated carbon ion-adsorption negative electrode. In these early embodiments HICs were meant to compete directly with electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs), rather than with the much higher energy secondary batteries. The HIC design then evolved to be based on a wide voltage (\u223c4.2 V) carbonate-based battery electrolyte, using an insertion titanium oxide compound anode (Li4Ti5O12, LixTi5O12) versus a Li ion adsorption porous carbon cathode. The modern Na and Li architectures contain a diverse range of nanostructured materials in both electrodes, including TiO2, Li7Ti5O12, Li4Ti5O12, Na6LiTi5O12, Na2Ti3O7, graphene, hard carbon, soft carbon, graphite, carbon nanosheets, pseudocapacitor T-Nb2O5, V2O5, MXene, conversion compounds MoS2, VN, MnO, and Fe2O3/Fe3O4, cathodes based on Na3V2(PO4)3, NaTi2(PO4)3, sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON), etc. The Ragone chart characteristics of HIC devices critically depend on their anode\u2013cathode architectures. Combining electrodes with the flattest capacity versus voltage characteristics, and the largest total voltage window, yields superior energy. Unfortunately \u201cflat voltage\u201d materials undergo significant volume expansion/contraction during cycling and are frequently lifetime limited. Overall more research on HIC cathodes is needed; apart from high surface area carbon, very few positive electrodes demonstrate the necessary 10\u202f000 or 100\u202f000 plus cycle life. It remains to be determined whether its lithium ion capacitors (LICs) or sodium ion capacitors (NICs) are superior in terms of energy\u2013power and cyclability.

Current research focuses on developing sensors for specific analytes in these application fields and addresses challenges that need to be solved before viable commercial products can be designed. These challenges typically include the lowering of the limit of detection, the integration of sample preparation into the device and hence analysis directly within a sample matrix, finding strategies for long-term in vivo use, etc. Today, functional nanomaterials are synthesized, investigated, and applied in electrochemical biosensors and lab-on-a-chip devices to assist in this endeavor. This review answers many questions around the nanomaterials used, their inherent properties and the chemistries they offer that are of interest to the analytical systems, and their roles in analytical applications in the past 5 years (2013\u20132018), and it gives a quantitative assessment of their positive effects on the analyses.

Chemical sensing aims to detect subtle changes in the chemical environment by transforming relevant chemical or physical properties of molecular or ionic species (i.e., analytes) into an analytically useful output. Optical arrays based on chemoresponsive colorants (dyes and nanoporous pigments) probe the chemical reactivity of analytes, rather than their physical properties (e.g., mass). The chemical specificity of the olfactory system does not come from specific receptors for specific analytes (e.g., the traditional lock-and-key model of substrate\u2013enzyme interactions), but rather olfaction makes use of pattern recognition of the combined response of several hundred olfactory receptors. In a similar fashion, arrays of chemoresponsive colorants provide high-dimensional data from the color or fluorescence changes of the dyes in these arrays as they are exposed to analytes. This provides chemical sensing with high sensitivity (often down to parts per billion levels), impressive discrimination among very similar analytes, and exquisite fingerprinting of extremely similar mixtures over a wide range of analyte types, in both the gas and liquid phases.

Further studies showed that, by tuning the potential parameters of a model tetrahedral system, it is possible to make the LLT evolve continuously from metastability to being thermodynamically stable with respect to crystallization. Most recently, it has been shown that the simulation code used to challenge the hypothesis of an LLT contains conceptual errors that invalidate the results on which the challenge was based, definitively resolving the controversy.

Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has been the dominant binder in the battery industry for decades despite several well-recognized drawbacks, i.e., limited binding strength due to the lack of chemical bonds with electroactive materials, insufficient mechanical properties, and low electronic and lithium-ion conductivities. The limited binding function cannot meet inherent demands of emerging electrode materials with high capacities such as silicon anodes and sulfur cathodes. To address these concerns, in this review we divide the binding between active materials and binders into two major mechanisms: mechanical interlocking and interfacial binding forces. We review existing and emerging binders, binding technology used in energy-storage devices (including lithium-ion batteries, lithium\u2013sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors), and state-of-the-art mechanical characterization and computational methods for binder research.

HPLC itself owes its immense popularity to it being relatively simple and inexpensive, with the equipment being reliable and easy to operate. Due to extensive automation, it can be run virtually unattended with multiple samples at various separation conditions, even by relatively low-skilled personnel. Currently, there are >600 RP-HPLC columns available to end users for purchase, some of which exhibit very large differences in selectivity and production quality. Often, two similar RP-HPLC columns are not equally suitable for the requisite separation, and to date, there is no universal RP-HPLC column covering a variety of analytes. This forces analytical laboratories to keep a multitude of diverse columns. Therefore, column selection is a crucial segment of RP-HPLC method development, especially since sample complexity is constantly increasing. Rationally choosing an appropriate column is complicated. In addition to the differences in the primary intermolecular interactions with analytes of the dispersive (London) type, individual columns can also exhibit a unique character owing to specific polar, hydrogen bond, and electron pair donor\u2013acceptor interactions. They can also vary depending on the type of packing, amount and type of residual silanols, \u201cend-capping\u201d, bonding density of ligands, and pore size, among others. Consequently, the chromatographic performance of RP-HPLC systems is often considerably altered depending on the selected column.

Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon imaging, including single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), comprise the imaging component of nuclear medicine. These areas are distinct in that they exploit different nuclear decay processes and also different imaging technologies. In PET, images are created from the 511 keV photons produced when the positron emitted by a radionuclide encounters an electron and is annihilated. In contrast, in single-photon imaging, images are created from the \u03b3 rays (and occasionally X-rays) directly emitted by the nucleus. Therapeutic nuclear medicine uses particulate radiation such as Auger or conversion electrons or \u03b2\u2013 or \u03b1 particles. All three of these technologies are linked by the requirement that the radionuclide must be attached to a suitable vector that can deliver it to its target. It is imperative that the radionuclide remain attached to the vector before it is delivered to its target as well as after it reaches its target or else the resulting image (or therapeutic outcome) will not reflect the biological process of interest.

In this context, concentrated solar power (CSP) stands out among other sustainable technologies because it offers the interesting possibility of storing energy collected from the sun as heat by sensible, latent, or thermochemical means. Accordingly, continuous electricity generation in the power block is possible even during off-sun periods, providing CSP plants with a remarkable dispatchability. Sensible heat storage has been already incorporated to commercial CSP plants. However, because of its potentially higher energy storage density, thermochemical heat storage (TCS) systems emerge as an attractive alternative for the design of next-generation power plants, which are expected to operate at higher temperatures. Through these systems, thermal energy is used to drive endothermic chemical reactions, which can subsequently release the stored energy when needed through a reversible exothermic step. This review analyzes the status of this prominent energy storage technology, its major challenges, and future perspectives, covering in detail the numerous strategies proposed for the improvement of materials and thermochemical reactors. Thermodynamic calculations allow selecting high energy density systems, but experimental findings indicate that sufficiently rapid kinetics and long-term stability trough continuous cycles of chemical transformation are also necessary for practical implementation. In addition, selecting easy-to-handle materials with reduced cost and limited toxicity is crucial for large-scale deployment of this technology. In this work, the possible utilization of materials as diverse as metal hydrides, hydroxides, or carbonates for thermochemical storage is discussed. Furthermore, special attention is paid to the development of redox metal oxides, such as Co3O4/CoO, Mn2O3/Mn3O4, and perovskites of different compositions, as an auspicious new class of TCS materials due to the advantage of working with atmospheric air as reactant, avoiding the need of gas storage tanks. Current knowledge about the structural, morphological, and chemical modifications of these solids, either caused during redox transformations or induced wittingly as a way to improve their properties, is revised in detail. In addition, the design of new reactor concepts proposed for the most efficient use of TCS in concentrated solar facilities is also critically considered.

Combined with fast time-resolved spectroscopic measurement, we can monitor the reactions of intermediate species on time scales ranging from picoseconds to seconds. The application of pulse radiolysis to water generates hydrated electrons (eaq\u2013) and specific radicals, rendering this technique useful for investigating a number of biological redox processes. The first pulse radiolysis redox investigations explored in this review involved intramolecular electron transfer processes in protein with multiple electron-accepting sites. Pulse radiolysis enabled direct monitoring of the internal electron transfer rates and the distribution of electrons within proteins. Structural information from X-ray data has allowed analysis of the rate constants and their activation parameters in relation to the mechanisms with current theoretical treatments. The second set of pulse radiolysis redox investigations explored here concerned the intermediates of enzyme reactions after redox reactions. Pulse radiolysis allowed the extremely rapid donation of electrons to a redox center in a protein. It makes it possible to observe the unstable intermediates after the reduction and the following subsequent steps. For example, the intermediates generated through the one-electron reduction of oxygenated hemoproteins, such as cytochrome P450 and nitric oxide synthase, were characterized. Interestingly, ligand exchange can occur upon the reduction of heme iron, in which different amino acid residues bind to heme in the ferrous and ferric states, respectively. We directly observed the ligand-switching intermediates of bacterial CooA, a CO sensor, and bacterial iron response regulator protein. These ligand exchange processes are physiologically important for regulating the electrode potential and effective formation of superoxide anion or HO\u2022. The third set of pulse radiolysis redox investigations explored in this review concerns free-radical processes in biological systems. Free radicals are produced in cells and organisms in a variety of processes. The cell has developed special and very effective machinery for controlling and detoxifying reactive radicals. Radiation-generated radicals allow studies of the reactions between specific radicals and solutes, often revealing the mechanisms underlying the initial and subsequent reactions. The crucial contribution was made using pulse radiolysis techniques and knowledge of the identities, properties, and reactions of radicals. These radicals include superoxide (O2\u2022\u2013), nitric monoxide (NO\u2022), ascorbate, urate, and protein radicals.

Several reviews and encyclopedia chapters on the properties and applications of fluoropolymers in general have been published, including various reviews that extensively report copolymers of TFE (listed below). Despite this, a thorough review of the specific methods of synthesis of the homopolymer, and the relationships between synthesis conditions and the physicochemical properties of the material prepared, has not been available. This Review intends to fill that gap. As known, PTFE and its marginally modified derivatives comprise some 60\u201365% of the total international fluoropolymer market with a global increase of ca. 7% per annum of its production. Numerous companies, such as Asahi Glass, Solvay Specialty Polymers, Daikin, DuPont/Chemours, Juhua, 3F, 3M/Dyneon, etc., produce TFE homopolymers. Such polymers, both high-molecular-mass materials and waxes, are chemically inert and hydrophobic and exhibit an excellent thermal stability as well as an exceptionally low coefficient of friction. These polymers find use in applications ranging from coatings and lubrication to pyrotechnics, and an extensive industry (electronic, aerospace, wires and cables, and textiles) has been built around them. South Africa, being the third largest producer of fluorspar (CaF2), the precursor to hydrogen fluoride and fluorine, has embarked on an industrial initiative to locally beneficiate its fluorspar reserves, with the local production of fluoropolymers being one projected outcome. As our manuscript focuses specifically on the homopolymerization of TFE (the starting point for all fluoropolymer industries), it will be of considerable use to start-up companies and other commercial entities looking to enter the fluoropolymer market, as well as to end-user companies. The manuscript commences with a short discussion on the synthesis and production of TFE (both at industrial and laboratory scales), including the safety aspects surrounding handling (because that monomer is regarded as explosive if brought into contact with oxygen due to the formation of peroxides), transport, and storage, and then expands into detailed discussions dealing with aspects such as the various additives used (buffers, chain transfer agents, surfactants, etc.), the solvent environment, and the reaction conditions. A further section reports the properties of PTFE with respect to the polymerization conditions as well as an overview on the specialized techniques used to characterize PTFE. Finally, the applications of PTFE in various fields, ranging from electrical insulation to tribological to medical applications, as well as chemically resistant coatings and pyrotechnics, are discussed."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00460": {"title": "Computational Modeling of Realistic Cell Membranes", "authors": ["Siewert J.

However, RTK interactions are more complicated, as RTKs can interact in the absence of ligand and heterodimerize within and across subfamilies. Here, we review the known cross-subfamily RTK heterointeractions and their possible biological implications, as well as the methodologies which have been used to study them. Moreover, we demonstrate how thermodynamic models can be used to study RTKs and to explain many of the complicated biological effects which have been described in the literature. Finally, we discuss the concept of the RTK interactome: a putative, extensive network of interactions between the RTKs. This RTK interactome can produce unique signaling outputs; can amplify, inhibit, and modify signaling; and can allow for signaling backups. The existence of the RTK interactome could provide an explanation for the irreproducibility of experimental data from different studies and for the failure of some RTK inhibitors to produce the desired therapeutic effects. We argue that a deeper knowledge of RTK interactome thermodynamics can lead to a better understanding of fundamental RTK signaling processes in health and disease.

Their tremendous success has spurred research and development of other metal-based drugs, with notable achievements. Generally, the vast majority of metal-based drug candidates in clinical and developmental stages are stoichiometric agents, i.e., each metal complex reacts only once with their biological target. Additionally, many of these metal complexes are involved in side reactions, which not only reduce the effective amount of the drug but may also cause toxicity. On a separate note, transition metal complexes and nanoparticles have a well-established history of being potent catalysts for selective molecular transformations, with examples such as the Mo- and Ru-based catalysts for metathesis reactions (Nobel Prize in 2005) or palladium catalysts for C\u2013C bond forming reactions such as Heck, Negishi, or Suzuki reactions (Nobel Prize in 2010). Also, notably, no direct biological equivalent of these transformations exists in a biological environment such as bacteria or mammalian cells. It is, therefore, only logical that recent interest has focused on developing transition-metal based catalytic systems that are capable of performing transformations inside cells, with the aim of inducing medicinally relevant cellular changes. Because unlike in stoichiometric reactions, a catalytically active compound may turn over many substrate molecules, only very small amounts of such a catalytic metallodrug are required to achieve a desired pharmacologic effect, and therefore, toxicity and side reactions are reduced. Furthermore, performing catalytic reactions in biological systems also opens the door for new methodologies to study the behavior of biomolecules in their natural state, e.g., via in situ labeling or by increasing/depleting their concentration at will. There is, of course, an art to the choice of catalysts and reactions which have to be compatible with biological conditions, namely an aqueous, oxygen-containing environment. In this review, we aim to describe new developments that bring together the far-distant worlds of transition-metal based catalysis and metal-based drugs, in what is termed \u201ccatalytic metallodrugs\u201d. Here we will focus on transformations that have been performed on small biomolecules (such as shifting equilibria like in the NAD+/NADH or GSH/GSSG couples), on non-natural molecules such as dyes for imaging purposes, or on biomacromolecules such as proteins. Neither reactions involving release (e.g., CO) or transformation of small molecules (e.g., 1O2 production), degradation of biomolecules such as proteins, RNA or DNA nor light-induced medicinal chemistry (e.g., photodynamic therapy) are covered, even if metal complexes are centrally involved in those. In each section, we describe the (inorganic) chemistry involved, as well as selected examples of biological applications in the hope that this snapshot of a new but quickly developing field will indeed inspire novel research and unprecedented interactions across disciplinary boundaries."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00495": {"title": "Introduction: Carbene Chemistry", "authors": ["F.

Knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms is the sine qua non of every functional assignment to membrane transporters. The basis of our current solubility diffusion model was laid by Meyer and Overton. It correlates the solubility of a substance in an organic phase with its membrane permeability. Since then, a wide range of studies challenging this rule have appeared. Commonly, the discrepancies have their origin in ill-used measurement approaches, as we demonstrate on the example of membrane CO2 transport. On the basis of the insight that scanning electrochemical microscopy offered into solute concentration distributions in immediate membrane vicinity of planar membranes, we analyzed the interplay between chemical reactions and diffusion for solvent transport, weak acid permeation, and enzymatic reactions adjacent to membranes. We conclude that buffer reactions must also be considered in spectroscopic investigations of weak acid transport in vesicular suspensions.

Strand-displacement reactions generally proceed by three-way or four-way branch migration and initially were investigated for their relevance to genetic recombination. Through the use of toeholds, which are single-stranded segments of DNA to which an invader strand can bind to initiate branch migration, the rate with which strand displacement reactions proceed can be varied by more than 6 orders of magnitude. In addition, the use of toeholds enables the construction of enzyme-free DNA reaction networks exhibiting complex dynamical behavior. A demonstration of this was provided in the year 2000, in which strand displacement reactions were employed to drive a DNA-based nanomachine (Yurke, B.; et al. Nature 2000, 406, 605\u2013608).

The free energy of NC ensembles is lowered by coarsening which can involve Ostwald ripening or Smoluchowski ripening (NC diffusion and coalescence). Preservation of individual NC structure and inhibition of coarsening are key, e.g., for avoiding catalyst degradation. This review focuses on postsynthesis evolution of metallic NCs.

For charge transport, we cover the basic principles governing the power factor and then review several strategies using NWs to enhance it, including earlier theoretical and experimental work on quantum confinement effects and semimetal-to-semiconductor transition, surface engineering and complex heterostructures to enhance the carrier mobility and power factor, and the recent emergence of topological insulator NWs. For phonon transport, we broadly categorize the work on thermal conductivity of NWs into five different effects: classic size effect, acoustic softening, surface roughness, complex NW morphology, and dimensional crossover.

We illustrate the use of these approaches to describe ion conduction and selectivity in voltage-gated sodium and acid-sensing ion channels. Studies of channel gating present a significant challenge, as activation occurs on longer time scales. Enhanced sampling approaches can ensure convergence on minimum free energy pathways for activation, as illustrated here for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that are principal to nervous system function and the actions of general anesthetics. We also examine recent studies of local anesthetic and antiepileptic drug binding to a sodium channel, revealing sites and pathways that may offer new targets for drug development.

The metal anode is the essential component of emerging energy storage systems such as sodium sulfur and sodium selenium, which are discussed as example full-cell applications. We begin with a description of the differences in the chemical and physical properties of Na metal versus the oft-studied Li metal, and a corresponding discussion regarding the number of ways in which Na does not follow Li-inherited paradigms in its electrochemical behavior. We detail the major challenges for Na-metal systems that at this time limit the feasibility of SMBs. The core Na anode problems are the following interrelated degradation mechanisms: An unstable solid electrolyte interphase with most organic electrolytes, \u201cmossy\u201d and \u201clath-like\u201d metal dendrite growth for liquid systems, poor Coulombic efficiency, and gas evolution. Even solid-state Na batteries are not immune, with metal dendrites being reported. The solutions may be subdivided into the following interrelated taxonomy: Improved electrolytes and electrolyte additives tailored for Na-metal anodes, interfacial engineering between the metal and the liquid or solid electrolyte, electrode architectures that both reduce the current density during plating\u2013stripping and serve as effective hosts that shield the Na metal from excessive reactions, and alloy design to tune the bulk properties of the metal per se. For instance, stable plating\u2013stripping of Na is extremely difficult with conventional carbonate solvents but has been reported with ethers and glymes. Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) such as beta-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE), sodium superionic conductor (NASICON), and sodium thiophosphate (75Na2S\u00b725P2S5) present highly exciting opportunities for SMBs that avoid the dangers of flammable liquids. Even SSEs are not immune to dendrites, however, which grow through the defects in the bulk pellet, but may be controlled through interfacial energy modification. We conclude with a discussion of the key research areas that we feel are the most fruitful for further pursuit. In our opinion, greatly improved understanding and control of the SEI structure is the key to cycling stability.

Special attention is given to the difference between the physical mechanism of covalent bond formation and its description with chemical bonding models, which are often confused. This is partly due to historical reasons, since until the development of quantum theory there was no physical basis for understanding the chemical bond. In the absence of such a basis, chemists developed heuristic models that proved extremely valuable for understanding and predicting experimental studies. The great success of these simple models and the associated rules led to the fact that the model conceptions were regarded as real images of physical reality. The complicated world of quantum theory, which eludes human imagination, made it difficult to link heuristic models of chemical bonding with quantum chemical knowledge. In the early days of quantum chemistry, some suggestions were made which have since proved untenable. In recent decades, there has been a stormy development of quantum chemical methods, which are not limited to the quantitative accuracy of the calculated properties. Also, methods have been developed where the experimentally developed models can be quantitatively expressed and visually represented using mathematically well-defined terms that are derived from quantum chemical calculations. The calculated numbers may however not be measurable values. Nevertheless, as orientation data for the interpretation and classification of experimental findings as well as a guideline for new experiments, they form a coordinate system that defines the multidimensional world of chemistry, which corresponds to the Hilbert space formalism of physics. The nonmeasurability of model values is not a weakness of chemistry but a characteristic by which the infinite complexity of the material world becomes scientifically accessible and very useful for chemical research.

To a greater extent than within acyclic molecules, these interactions within macrocycles are coupled such that changing one dihedral angle can significantly affect other dihedral angles, further complicating the situation. However, this coupling of bond rotations and transannular interactions enables the transmission of three-dimensional information from one side of a macrocycle to the other. Making relatively small structural modifications to a macrocycle can result in local conformational changes that propagate along the ring to affect distal structural features. The factors that control how such changes can propagate are poorly understood, and it is difficult to predict which modifications will result in significant conformational reorganizations of remote regions of a macrocycle.

However, understanding allosteric signaling and the associated dynamics between distinct allosteric states at the molecular level is challenging and requires novel experiments complemented by computational studies. In this review, we first describe symmetry and rigidity as essential requirements for allosteric proteins or multisubunit structures. The general features, with MWC and KNF as two extreme scenarios, emerge when allosteric signaling is viewed from an energy landscape perspective. To go beyond the general theories, we describe computational tools that are either based solely on multiple sequences or their structures to predict the allostery wiring diagram. These methods could be used to predict the network of residues that carry allosteric signals. Methods to obtain molecular insights into the dynamics of allosteric transitions are briefly mentioned. The utility of the methods is illustrated by applications to systems ranging from monomeric proteins in which there is little conformational change in the transition between two allosteric states to membrane bound G-protein coupled receptors and multisubunit proteins. Finally, the role allostery plays in the functions of ATP-consuming molecular machines, bacterial chaperonin GroEL and molecular motors, is described. Although universal molecular principles governing allosteric signaling do not exist, we can draw the following general conclusions from a survey of different systems. (1) Multiple pathways connecting allosteric states are highly heterogeneous. (2) Allosteric signaling is exquisitely sensitive to the specific architecture of the system, which implies that the capacity for allostery is encoded in the structure itself. (3) The mechanical modes that connect distinct allosteric states are robust to sequence variations.

Strategies for the development of polarizable models are presented with a specific focus on extracting atomic polarizabilities. Finally, we compare simulations using polarizable and nonpolarizable models for several classes of ionic systems, discussing the underlying physics that each approach includes or ignores, implications for implementation and computational efficiency, and the accuracy of properties predicted by these methods compared to experiments."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00764": {"title": "Introduction: Chemical Sensors", "authors": ["Timothy M.

Non-ribosomal synthesis in bacteria, fungi, and plants or synthetic chemistry can introduce unnatural amino acids and non-peptidic constraints that modify peptide backbones and side chains to fine-tune cyclic peptide structure. Structures can be potentially altered further upon binding to a protein in biological environments. Here we analyze three-dimensional crystal structures for 211 bioactive cyclic peptides bound to 65 different proteins. The protein-bound cyclic peptides were examined for similarities and differences in bonding modes, for main-chain and side-chain structure, and for the importance of polarity, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic effects, and water molecules in interactions with proteins. Many protein-bound cyclic peptides show backbone structures like those (strands, sheets, turns, helices, loops, or distorted variations) found at protein\u2013protein binding interfaces. However, the notion of macrocycles simply as privileged scaffolds that primarily project side-chain substituents for complementary interactions with proteins is dispelled here. Unlike small-molecule drugs, the cyclic peptides do not rely mainly upon hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions for protein binding; they also use their main chain and side chains to form polar contacts and hydrogen bonds with proteins. Compared to small-molecule ligands, cyclic peptides can bind across larger, polar, and water-exposed protein surface areas, making many more contacts that can increase affinity, selectivity, biological activity, and ligand\u2013receptor residence time. Cyclic peptides have a greater capacity than small-molecule drugs to modulate protein\u2013protein interfaces that involve large, shallow, dynamic, polar, and water-exposed protein surfaces."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00005": {"title": "On-Line Analysis of Exhaled Breath", "authors": ["Tobias Bruderer", "Thomas Gaisl", "Martin T.

Special emphasis is given to the use of the technology in diagnosing respiratory diseases, potential niche applications, and the promise of breath analysis for personalized medicine.

The latter can be utilized for untargeted analysis of exhaled breath, with the capability to identify hitherto unknown molecules. The interpretation of the resulting big data sets is complex and often constrained due to a limited number of participants. Even larger data sets will be needed for assessing reproducibility and for validation of biomarker candidates. In addition, molecular structures and quantification of compounds are generally not easily available from on-line measurements and require complementary measurements, for example, a separation method coupled to mass spectrometry.

Taking into consideration previous review articles on NP/polymer catalysts, we limited this review to a discussion of a narrow temporal scope (2017\u2013April 2019), while embracing a broad subject scope, i.e., considering any polymers and NPs which form catalytic nanocomposites. This gives us a unique view of the field of catalytic polymer nanocomposites and allows understanding of where the field is going."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00145": {"title": "Coumarin-Based Small-Molecule Fluorescent Chemosensors", "authors": ["Duxia Cao", "Zhiqiang Liu", "Peter Verwilst", "Seyoung Koo", "Paramesh Jangjili", "Jong Seung Kim*", "Weiying Lin*"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2019, "volume": 119, "issue": 18, "page_start": 10403, "page_end": 10519, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "July 17, 2019", "abstract": "Coumarins are a very large family of compounds containing the unique 2H-chromen-2-one motif, as it is known according to IUPAC nomenclature.

We focus on four mechanisms that have been proposed to affect measured charge carrier recombination lifetimes, namely: (1) recombination via trap states, (2) polaron formation, (3) the indirect nature of the bandgap (e.g., Rashba effect), and (4) photon recycling. We scrutinize the evidence for each case and the implications of each process on carrier recombination dynamics. Although they have attracted considerable speculation, we conclude that multiple trapping or hopping in shallow trap states, and the possible indirect nature of the bandgap (e.g., Rashba effect), seem to be less likely given the combined evidence, at least in high-quality samples most relevant to solar cells and light-emitting diodes. On the other hand, photon recycling appears to play a clear role in increasing apparent lifetime for samples with high photoluminescence quantum yields. We conclude that polaron dynamics are intriguing and deserving of further study. We highlight potential interdependencies of these processes and suggest future experiments to better decouple their relative contributions.

This review first briefly summarizes this background of MOF nanoparticle catalysis and then comprehensively reviews the fast-growing literature reported during the last years. The major parts are catalysis of organic and molecular reactions, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and views of prospects. Major challenges of our society are addressed using these well-defined heterogeneous catalysts in the fields of synthesis, energy, and environment. In spite of the many achievements, enormous progress is still necessary to improve our understanding of the processes involved beyond the proof-of-concept, particularly for selective methane oxidation, hydrogen production, water splitting, CO2 reduction to methanol, nitrogen fixation, and water depollution."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00226": {"title": "Single Molecule Photocatalysis on TiO2 Surfaces", "authors": ["Qing Guo", "Zhibo Ma", "Chuanyao Zhou", "Zefeng Ren", "Xueming Yang*"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2019, "volume": 119, "issue": 20, "page_start": 11020, "page_end": 11041, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "September 10, 2019", "abstract": "Heterogeneous photocatalysis has been widely applied in various fields, such as photovoltaic cell, solar water splitting, photocatalytic pollutant degradation, and so on.

In turn, these studies have both led to an increased understanding of their mechanisms of action as well as facilitated a range of applications in agriculture and medicine, as ecofriendly crop protection agents, and as drug leads or scaffolds for pharmaceutical design. Our overall objective in this Review is to provide readers with a comprehensive overview of cyclotides that we hope will stimulate further work on this fascinating family of peptides."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00404": {"title": "Interrogating Amyloid Aggregates using Fluorescent Probes", "authors": ["Amir Aliyan", "Nathan P.

The standard methods for studying crystalline or solution-phase proteins (X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy) are not well-suited for studying proteins at interfaces, and for these proteins we still lack a corresponding technique that can provide the same level of structural resolution. This is not surprising in view of the challenges involved in probing the structure of proteins within monomolecular films assembled at a very thin interface in situ. Vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy has the potential to overcome this challenge and investigate the structure and dynamics of proteins at interfaces at the molecular level with subpicosecond time resolution. While SFG studies were initially limited to simple model peptides, the past decade has seen a dramatic advancement of experimental techniques and data analysis methods that has made it possible to also study interfacial proteins and their folding, binding, orientation, hydration, and dynamics. In this review, we first explain the principles of SFG spectroscopy and the experimental and theoretical methods to measure and analyze protein SFG spectra.

This review summarizes strategies to employ quantitative structure\u2212selectivity relationships (QSSR) in asymmetric catalytic reactions. The coverage is structured by initially introducing the basic features of these methods. Subsequent topics are discussed according to increasing complexity of molecular representations. As the most applied subfield of QSSR in enantioselective catalysis, the application of local parametrization approaches and linear free energy relationships (LFERs) along with multivariate modeling techniques is described first. This section is followed by a description of global parametrization methods, the first of which is continuous chirality measures (CCM) because it is a single parameter derived from the global structure of a molecule. Chirality codes, global, multivariate descriptors, are then introduced followed by molecular interaction fields (MIFs), a global descriptor class that typically has the highest dimensionality. To highlight the current reach of QSSR in enantioselective transformations, a comprehensive collection of examples is presented.

The above developments have been employed to successfully describe photophysics in a variety of molecular materials."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00449": {"title": "Infrared Difference Spectroscopy of Proteins: From Bands to Bonds", "authors": ["Victor A.

Compared with other spectroscopic methods, it stands out by its sensitivity to the protonation state, H-bonding, and the conformation of different groups in proteins, including the peptide backbone, amino acid side chains, internal water molecules, or cofactors. In particular, the detection of protonation and H-bonding changes in a time-resolved manner, not easily obtained by other techniques, is one of the most successful applications of IR difference spectroscopy. The present review deals with the use of perturbations designed to specifically change the protein between two (or more) functionally relevant states, a strategy often referred to as reaction-induced IR difference spectroscopy. In the first half of this contribution, I review the technique of reaction-induced IR difference spectroscopy of proteins, with special emphasis given to the preparation of suitable samples and their characterization, strategies for the perturbation of proteins, and methodologies for time-resolved measurements (from nanoseconds to minutes). The second half of this contribution focuses on the spectral interpretation. It starts by reviewing how changes in H-bonding, medium polarity, and vibrational coupling affect vibrational frequencies, intensities, and bandwidths. It is followed by band assignments, a crucial aspect mostly performed with the help of isotopic labeling and site-directed mutagenesis, and complemented by integration and interpretation of the results in the context of the studied protein, an aspect increasingly supported by spectral calculations.

In this review, the chemistry of ribozymes and the influence of pressure is described. In the case of the hairpin ribozyme, pressure slowed down the self-cleavage reaction on the basis that the formation of the transition state involves a positive \u0394V\u29e7 of activation and the release of 78 \u00b1 4 water molecules. The self-cleaving activity of the hammerhead ribozyme is also slowed down by pressure on the basis of kinetic parameters and \u0394Vs comparable to those of the hairpin ribozymes.

However, the function and metabolism of this long-neglected polymer are scarcely known, especially in higher eukaryotes. In recent years, interest in polyP experienced a renaissance, beginning with the discovery of polyP as phosphate source in bone mineralization. Later, two discoveries placed polyP into the focus of regenerative medicine applications. First, polyP shows morphogenetic activity, i.e., induces cell differentiation via gene induction, and, second, acts as an energy storage and donor in the extracellular space. Studies on acidocalcisomes and mitochondria provided first insights into the enzymatic basis of eukaryotic polyP formation. In addition, a concerted action of alkaline phosphatase and adenylate kinase proved crucial for ADP/ATP generation from polyP. PolyP added extracellularly to mammalian cells resulted in a 3-fold increase of ATP.

Therefore, secondary batteries composed of earth-abundant elements are desired to complement LIBs. In recent years, K-ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted significant attention as potential alternatives to LIBs. Previous studies have developed positive and negative electrode materials for KIBs and demonstrated several unique advantages of KIBs over LIBs and Na-ion batteries (NIBs). Thus, besides being free from any scarce/toxic elements, the low standard electrode potentials of K/K+ electrodes lead to high operation voltages competitive to those observed in LIBs. Moreover, K+ ions exhibit faster ionic diffusion in electrolytes due to weaker interaction with solvents and anions than that of Li+ ions; this is essential to realize high-power KIBs. This review comprehensively covers the studies on electrochemical materials for KIBs, including electrode and electrolyte materials and a discussion on recent achievements and remaining/emerging issues.

Sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the molecular-level structure of these interfaces because SFG can specifically probe the topmost interfacial water molecules separately from the bulk and is sensitive to molecular conformation. Nevertheless, experimental SFG has several limitations. For example, SFG cannot provide information on the depth of the interface and how the orientation of the molecules varies with distance from the surface. By combining the SFG spectroscopy with simulation techniques, one can directly compare the experimental data with the simulated SFG spectra, allowing us to unveil the molecular-level structure of water\u2013air and ice\u2013air interfaces. Here, we present an overview of the different simulation protocols available for SFG spectra calculations.

In this Review, we aimed to disclose how the unique catalytic abilities of Au are generated with respect to (a) the contact structures between Au and its supports and (b) the size of the Au particles. For CO oxidation, the catalytic activity of Au on reducible metal oxides (MOx) is strongly correlated with the amount of oxygen vacancies of the MOx surface, which play a key role in O2 activation. Single atoms, bilayers of Au, sub-nm clusters, clusters (1\u20132 nm), and NPs (2\u20135 nm) have been proposed as the active sizes of the Au species, which may depend on the type of support. For propylene epoxidation, the presence of isolated TiO4 units in SiO2 supports is important for the production of propylene oxide (PO). Au NPs facilitate the formation of Ti\u2013OOH species, which leads to PO in the presence of H2 and O2, whereas Au clusters facilitate propylene hydrogenation. However, Au clusters can produce PO by using only O2 and water, whereas Au NPs cannot. For alcohol oxidation, the reducibility of the MOx supports greatly influences the catalytic activity of Au, and single Au atoms more effectively activate the lattice oxygen of CeO2. The basic and acidic sites of the MOx surface also play an important role in the deprotonation of alcohols and the activation of aldehydes, respectively. For selective hydrogenation, heterolytic dissociation of H2 takes place at the interface between Au and MOx, and the basic sites of MOx contribute to H2 activation.

Metamaterials are artificial, engineered materials with broad metaphotonic prospects such as negative refraction, perfect lensing, subwavelength imaging, and cloaking. The possibility of achieving metaphotonic properties using metamaterials based on layered 2D materials has been extensively exploited. Because they are highly tunable and adjustable with the ease of micro- and nanofabrication, 2D materials exhibit diverse optical properties such as natural negative refraction, natural anisotropic behavior, and even hyperbolic dispersion. A combination of 2D materials with conventional metamaterials promises a variety of prospective applications. In this review, we illustrate how the concept of metamaterials and their associated metaphotonic capabilities are naturally born in 2D materials. The multifunctionality of 2D materials may enable the manufacture of novel optical devices that work in a broad frequency range, from visible to terahertz, with particularly low loss, high speed, gated tunability, and miniaturized sizes.

We review known or hypothesized molecular decomposition mechanisms for all five classes of aqueous redox-active organics and organometallics for which cycling lifetime results have been reported: quinones, viologens, aza-aromatics, iron coordination complexes, and nitroxide radicals. We collect, analyze, and compare capacity fade rates from all aqueous organic electrolytes that have been utilized in the capacity-limiting side of flow or hybrid flow/nonflow cells, noting also their redox potentials and demonstrated concentrations of transferrable electrons. We categorize capacity fade rates as being \u201chigh\u201d (>1%/day), \u201cmoderate\u201d (0.1\u20131%/day), \u201clow\u201d (0.02\u20130.1%/day), and \u201cextremely low\u201d (\u22640.02%/day) and discuss the degree to which the fade rates have been linked to decomposition mechanisms. Capacity fade is observed to be time-denominated rather than cycle-denominated, with a temporal rate that can depend on molecular concentrations and electrolyte state of charge through, e.g., bimolecular decomposition mechanisms. We then review measurement methods for capacity fade rate and find that simple galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge cycling is inadequate for assessing capacity fade when fade rates are low or extremely low and recommend refining methods to include potential holds for accurately assessing molecular lifetimes under such circumstances. We consider separately symmetric cell cycling results, the interpretation of which is simplified by the absence of a different counter-electrolyte.

In this comprehensive review, we present results of many such developments in this fast-growing field including (i) endohedrally doped Al, Ga, and In clusters, (ii) small endohedral carbon fullerene cages with \u2264 28 carbon atoms, (iii) metal doped boron cages, (iv) endohedrally doped cages of group 14 elements (Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb), (v) coinage metal (Cu, Ag, Au) cages doped with a transition metal atom as well as their ligated clusters and crystals, (vi) endohedrally doped cages of compound semiconductors, and (vii) multilayer Matryoshka cages and core\u2013shell structures. In a large number of cases, we have performed ab initio calculations to present updated results of the most stable atomic structures and fundamental electronic properties of the endohedrally doped cage clusters. We discuss electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic properties in order to shed light on their potential applications. The stability of the doped cage clusters has been correlated to the concept of filling the electronic shells for superatoms such as within a spherical potential model and also using various electron counting rules including Wade\u2013Mingos rules, systems with 18 and 32 electrons, and the spherical aromaticity rule. We also discuss cluster\u2013cluster interaction in cluster dimers and assemblies of some of the promising doped cage clusters in different dimensions.

In addition, tumor-targeting vectors with a short circulation time (e.g., Nanobody) or with an enhanced binding affinity (e.g., bispecific antibody) are being used to design novel immunoPET probes.

The translation machinery dominates the set of genes that are shared as orthologues across the tree of life. The lineage of the translation system defines the universal tree of life. The function of a ribosome is to build ribosomes; to accomplish this task, ribosomes make ribosomal proteins, polymerases, enzymes, and signaling proteins. Every coded protein ever produced by life on Earth has passed through the exit tunnel, which is the birth canal of biology. During the root phase of the tree of life, before the last common ancestor of life (LUCA), exit tunnel evolution is dominant and unremitting. Protein folding coevolved with evolution of the exit tunnel. The ribosome shows that protein folding initiated with intrinsic disorder, supported through a short, primitive exit tunnel. Folding progressed to thermodynamically stable \u03b2-structures and then to kinetically trapped \u03b1-structures. The latter were enabled by a long, mature exit tunnel that partially offset the general thermodynamic tendency of all polypeptides to form \u03b2-sheets. RNA chaperoned the evolution of protein folding from the very beginning. The universal common core of the ribosome, with a mass of nearly 2 million Daltons, was finalized by LUCA. The ribosome entered stasis after LUCA and remained in that state for billions of years. Bacterial ribosomes never left stasis. Archaeal ribosomes have remained near stasis, except for the superphylum Asgard, which has accreted rRNA post LUCA.

In order to gain incisive and quantitative information on the local electrostatic environment, molecular conformation, protein structure and interprotein contacts, ligand binding kinetics, and electric and optical properties of functional materials, a variety of vibrational probes have been developed and site-specifically incorporated into molecular, biological, and material systems for time-resolved vibrational spectroscopic investigation. However, still, an all-encompassing theory that describes the vibrational solvatochromism, electrochromism, and dynamic fluctuation of vibrational frequencies has not been completely established mainly due to the intrinsic complexity of intermolecular interactions in condensed phases. In particular, the amount of data obtained from the linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic experiments has been rapidly increasing, but the lack of a quantitative method to interpret these measurements has been one major obstacle in broadening the applications of these methods. Among various theoretical models, one of the most successful approaches is a semiempirical model generally referred to as the vibrational spectroscopic map that is based on a rigorous theory of intermolecular interactions. Recently, genetic algorithm, neural network, and machine learning approaches have been applied to the development of vibrational solvatochromism theory. In this review, we provide comprehensive descriptions of the theoretical foundation and various examples showing its extraordinary successes in the interpretations of experimental observations.

We focus on molecular simulation studies, alongside selected structural and other experimental investigations. Structures of biological nanopores and channels are reviewed, emphasizing those high-resolution crystal structures, which reveal water molecules within the transmembrane pores, which can be used to aid the interpretation of simulation studies. Different levels of molecular simulations of water within nanopores are described, with a focus on molecular dynamics (MD). In particular, models of water for MD simulations are discussed in detail to provide an evaluation of their use in simulations of water in nanopores. Simulation studies of the behavior of water in idealized models of nanopores have revealed aspects of the organization and dynamics of nanoconfined water, including wetting/dewetting in narrow hydrophobic nanopores. A survey of simulation studies in a range of nonbiological nanopores is presented, including carbon nanotubes, synthetic nanopores, model peptide nanopores, track-etched nanopores in polymer membranes, and hydroxylated and functionalized nanoporous silica. These reveal a complex relationship between pore size/geometry, the nature of the pore lining, and rates of water transport. Wider nanopores with hydrophobic linings favor water flow whereas narrower hydrophobic pores may show dewetting. Simulation studies over the past decade of the behavior of water in a range of biological nanopores are described, including porins and \u03b2-barrel protein nanopores, aquaporins and related polar solute pores, and a number of different classes of ion channels. Water is shown to play a key role in proton transport in biological channels and in hydrophobic gating of ion channels. An overall picture emerges, whereby the behavior of water in a nanopore may be predicted as a function of its hydrophobicity and radius. This informs our understanding of the functions of diverse channel structures and will aid the design of novel nanopores. Thus, our current level of understanding allows for the design of a nanopore which promotes wetting over dewetting or vice versa. However, to design a novel nanopore, which enables fast, selective, and gated flow of water de novo would remain challenging, suggesting a need for further detailed simulations alongside experimental evaluation of more complex nanopore systems."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00833": {"title": "Chemical Strategies to Boost Cancer Vaccines", "authors": ["Wen-Hao Li", "Yan-Mei Li*"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2020, "volume": 120, "issue": 20, "page_start": 11420, "page_end": 11478, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "September 11, 2020", "abstract": "Personalized cancer vaccines (PCVs) are reinvigorating vaccine strategies in cancer immunotherapy.

Following a sequential scheme of tumor biopsy, mutation analysis, and epitope prediction, the administration of neoantigens with synthetic long peptide (SLP) or mRNA formulations dramatically improves the population and activity of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

We anticipate that this review will provide some inspiration for the future discovery of the single-atom photocatalysts, manifestly stimulating the development in this emerging research area."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00842": {"title": "Proton Transport in Metal\u2013Organic Frameworks", "authors": ["Dae-Woon Lim*", "Hiroshi Kitagawa*"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2020, "volume": 120, "issue": 16, "page_start": 8416, "page_end": 8467, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "May 14, 2020", "abstract": "Solid-state proton conductors (SSPCs), which are a key component for the safety and efficiency of fuel cells, have received much attention due to their broad application in electrochemical devices. In particular, the development of new materials with high conducting performance and an understanding of the conduction mechanism have become critical issues in this field. Porous metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have recently emerged and have been extensively studied as a new type of proton conductor due to their crystallinity, designability, and high porosity. These properties are able to adsorb the guest molecules working as conducting media. During the past decade, major advances in proton-conductive MOFs have been achieved with high performance (>10\u20132 S cm\u20131), comparable to the conventional material, via various synthetic strategies, and the veiled conduction mechanism has been elucidated through structure analysis and spectroscopy tools such as NMR, X-ray diffraction, and neutron scattering measurement. This Review aims to summarize and provide a comprehensive understanding of proton transport in MOFs. Here, we discuss the fundamental principles and various design strategies and implementations aimed at enhancing proton conductivity with representative examples. We also deal with characterization methods used to investigate proton-conductive MOFs and computational/theoretical studies that aid in understanding the conduction mechanism. Finally, future endeavors are suggested regarding the challenges of research for practical SSPCs."}, "10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00846": {"title": "Continuous Flow Upgrading of Selected C2\u2013C6 Platform Chemicals Derived from Biomass", "authors": ["Romaric G\u00e9rardy", "Damien P.

The forecast of population growth over the next 3 decades is a very strong incentive for the identification of alternative primary resources other than petro-based ones. In contrast with fossil resources, renewable biomass is a virtually inexhaustible reservoir of chemical building blocks. Shifting the current industrial paradigm from almost exclusively petro-based resources to alternative bio-based raw materials requires more than vibrant political messages; it requires a profound revision of the concepts and technologies on which industrial chemical processes rely. Only a small fraction of molecules extracted from biomass bears significant chemical and commercial potentials to be considered as ubiquitous chemical platforms upon which a new, bio-based industry can thrive. Owing to its inherent assets in terms of unique process experience, scalability, and reduced environmental footprint, flow chemistry arguably has a major role to play in this context. This review covers a selection of C2 to C6 bio-based chemical platforms with existing commercial markets including polyols (ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, glycerol, 1,4-butanediol, xylitol, and sorbitol), furanoids (furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural) and carboxylic acids (lactic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, itaconic acid, and levulinic acid). The aim of this review is to illustrate the various aspects of upgrading bio-based platform molecules toward commodity or specialty chemicals using new process concepts that fall under the umbrella of continuous flow technology and that could change the future perspectives of biorefineries."}, "10.1021/cr000001%2B": {"title": "Applications of Radiolabeled Boron Clusters to the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer.

Although zwitterionic and mesoionic mesogens are also treated to some extent, emphasis will be directed toward liquid-crystalline materials consisting of organic cations and organic/inorganic anions that are not covalently bound but interact via electrostatic and other noncovalent interactions."}, "10.1021/cr400341h": {"title": "Safe Clinical Use of Carbon Nanotubes as Innovative Biomaterials", "authors": ["Naoto Saito*", "Hisao Haniu", "Yuki Usui", "Kaoru Aoki", "Kazuo Hara", "Seiji Takanashi", "Masayuki Shimizu", "Nobuyo Narita", "Masanori Okamoto", "Shinsuke Kobayashi", "Hiroki Nomura", "Hiroyuki Kato", "Naoyuki Nishimura", "Seiichi Taruta", "Morinobu Endo"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2014, "volume": 114, "issue": 11, "page_start": 6040, "page_end": 6079, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "April 10, 2014", "abstract": null}, "10.1021/cr400344n": {"title": "Molecular Machines Like Myosin Use Randomness to Behave Predictably", "authors": ["Peter Karagiannis", "Yoshiharu Ishii", "Toshio Yanagida*"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2014, "volume": 114, "issue": 6, "page_start": 3318, "page_end": 3334, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "January 31, 2014", "abstract": null}, "10.1021/cr400352m": {"title": "Fluorescence and Colorimetric Chemosensors for Fluoride-Ion Detection", "authors": ["Ying Zhou", "Jun Feng Zhang", "Juyoung Yoon*"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2014, "volume": 114, "issue": 10, "page_start": 5511, "page_end": 5571, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "March 25, 2014", "abstract": null}, "10.1021/cr400353v": {"title": "Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells: Morphology and Performance Relationships", "authors": ["Ye Huang", "Edward J.

Direct participation of catalyst atoms in this chemical process determines the significance of the surface structure of a catalyst in a fundamental understanding of such a chemical process at a molecular level. High-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (HP-STM) and environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) have been used to observe catalyst structure in the last few decades. In this review, instrumentation for the two in situ/operando techniques and scientific findings on catalyst structures under reaction conditions and during catalysis are discussed with the following objectives: (1) to present the fundamental aspects of in situ/operando studies of catalysts; (2) to interpret the observed restructurings of catalyst and evolution of catalyst structures; (3) to explore how HP-STM and ETEM can be synergistically used to reveal structural details under reaction conditions and during catalysis; and (4) to discuss the future challenges and prospects of atomic-scale observation of catalysts in understanding of heterogeneous catalysis. This Review focuses on the development of HP-STM and ETEM, the in situ/operando characterizations of catalyst structures with them, and the integration of the two structural analytical techniques for fundamentally understanding catalysis."}, "10.1021/cr500266a": {"title": "Reaction Mechanism of Cytochrome c Oxidase", "authors": ["Shinya Yoshikawa*", "Atsuhiro Shimada"], "journal": "Chemical Reviews", "year": 2015, "volume": 115, "issue": 4, "page_start": 1936, "page_end": 1989, "article_type": "Review", "pub_date": "January 20, 2015", "abstract": null}, "10.1021/cr50026a001": {"title": "The Chemistry Of Adrenochrome And Related Compounds", "authors": ["R.

The \u2022OH radicals are omnipresent in the environment (natural waters, atmosphere, interstellar space, etc.), including biological systems where \u2022OH has an important role in immunity metabolism. We provide an extensive view on the role of hydroxyl radical in different environmental compartments and in laboratory systems, with the aim of drawing more attention to this emerging issue. Further research on processes related to the hydroxyl radical chemistry in the environmental compartments is highly demanded. A comprehensive understanding of the sources and sinks of \u2022OH radicals including their implications in the natural waters and in the atmosphere is of crucial importance, including the way irradiated chromophoric dissolved organic matter in surface waters yields \u2022OH through the H2O2-independent pathway, and the assessment of the relative importance of gas-phase vs aqueous-phase reactions of \u2022OH with many atmospheric components. Moreover, considering the fact that people spend so much more time in dwellings than outside, the impact of the reactivity of indoor hydroxyl radicals on health and well-being is another emerging research topic of great concern."}, "10.1021/cr5003134": {"title": "Drug Strategies Targeting CYP51 in Neglected Tropical Diseases", "authors": ["Jun Yong Choi", "Larissa M.

The present review subjects this intriguing phenomenon to comprehensive analysis. All aspects of the subject are examined in detail, including the structures of monomeric and dimeric forms, the mechanism of dimerization, features that favor or disfavor dimerization, thermodynamic and kinetic factors, dimerization under specific conditions (including in solution, in the solid state, and on surfaces), and the special associative behavior of dinitroso and polynitroso compounds. By summarizing the current state of knowledge, the review promises to spur further advances in the evergreen field of C-nitroso chemistry, including the discovery of new ways to exploit the reversible dimerization of nitrosoarenes."}, "10.1021/cr500523x": {"title": "Cubane: 50 Years Later", "authors": ["Kyle F.
