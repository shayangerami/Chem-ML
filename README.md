# Chem-ML

Introduction:

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing complex datasets and making predictions based on patterns and relationships within the data. In the field of chemistry, machine learning methods can be applied to various areas, such as drug discovery, material science, and reaction prediction. This repository aims to provide a collection of machine learning models and algorithms that can be applied to chemistry-based datasets.

Datasets:

The repository includes several example datasets that can be used for training and evaluating machine learning models. These datasets cover a range of chemistry-related problems, including:

Property prediction

Reaction prediction

Molecular structure analysis

Each dataset is provided in a standardized format suitable for machine learning tasks. 

The repository provides a set of scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different machine learning methods applied to the chemistry datasets. These resources can be used as a starting point for your own experiments or as a reference for implementing machine learning models in chemistry.

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional machine learning methods to include, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions can help expand the range of applications and resources available for applying machine learning in chemistry.
